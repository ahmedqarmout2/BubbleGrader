# WebRTC code samples

This is a repository for the WebRTC JavaScript code samples. All of the samples can be tested from [webrtc.github.io/samples](https://webrtc.github.io/samples).

We welcome contributions and bugfixes. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Testing

Some of the samples have an associated test. These are currently using [Nightwatch.JS](https://nightwatchjs.org) and
are only testing the UI of the samples. The purpose of these is to provide examples of how you can write UI tests for
your WebRTC web application.

## Bugs

If you encounter a bug or problem with one of the samples, please submit a
[new issue](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/issues/new) so we know about it and can fix it.

Please avoid submitting issues on this repository for general problems you have with WebRTC. If you have found a bug in
the WebRTC APIs, please see [webrtc.org/bugs](https://webrtc.org/bugs) for how to submit bugs on the affected browsers.
If you need support on how to implement your own WebRTC-based application, please see the
[discuss-webrtc](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/discuss-webrtc) Google Group.
