# WebRTC welcomes patches/pulls for features and bug fixes!

For contributors external to Google, follow the instructions given in the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual).
In all cases, contributors must sign a contributor license agreement before a contribution can be accepted.
Please complete the agreement for an [individual](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual) or
a [corporation](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate) as appropriate.

If you plan to add a new sample or make significant changes to an existing sample, we recommend that you start by creating
a [new issue](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/issues/new) where we can discuss the details.

When creating a new sample or updating an existing one, please make sure you also create, or update any existing, tests.
All tests in this repository are implemented as Nightwatch.JS UI tests, so please follow the same design in your own.
